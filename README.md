## Overview

This module installs the [aptly](www.aptly.info) Debian packages repository manager and configures it.

## Module Description

What is this module capable of doing?

 * Installing the aptly package in a specific version (or just the latest available)
 * Managing a specific user and group (with their corresponding fixed uid/gid) dedicated to the service
 * Configuring a specific debian repository (optional) where to find the package
 * Managing the `/etc/aptly.conf` file
 * Enabling/starting or disabling the service
 * Enabling/starting or disabling the API
 * Managing the init.d service file
 * Managing apt mirrors, repositories, snapshots and publications
 
The aptly service will listen on port you configure (example: 8080) on every interfaces (configurable)
using the `aptly serve -listen=":8080"` command.

If you want to make the repository being served by an apache, nginx or whatever
else, just disable the service and setup the http server you want for the HTTP(S)
layer in addition to this module.

## Setup

### What aptly affects

Files managed by the module:

 * `/etc/aptly.conf`
 * `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/aptly.list` (optional)
 * `/etc/init.d/aptly`

### Setup Requirements

The module requires:
 * [Puppetlabs stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib.git)
 * [Puppetlab's APT module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt.git) at least version 2.0.x

### Beginning with aptly

The module can be used out of the box directly, it just requires puppetlabs' apt
module and its stdlib to be in your modulepath.

To install:

```
puppet module install TubeMogul/aptly
```

Puppet will install the dependencies automatically, but if you want to install
the dependencies 1 by 1, you can use this before:

```
puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib
puppet module install puppetlabs/apt
```

## Usage

**WARNING:** the aptly service won't start as long as nothing has been published
in it. It is a totally expected behavior coming from aptly itself.

Those examples include the puppet-only configuration, and the corresponding
configuration for those who use hiera (I find it more convenient for copy/paste
of a full configuration when you have both - yes, I'm lazy ;-) ).

### Basic example

The default values are normally sane enough to do as few parameters overwrites
as possible.

But let's say you want:
 * Aptly to store its data in `/data` (that you created before hand)
 * to only have the architectures `i386` and `amd64`
 * to have your ppa codename to be `foo`

Then you just do:
```puppet
class { 'aptly':
  root_dir      => '/data',
  architectures => ['i386', 'amd64'],
  ppa_codename  => 'foo',
}
```

Or using hiera:
```yaml
---
aptly::root_dir: /data
aptly::architectures:
  - i386
  - amd64
aptly::ppa_codename: foo
```

**NOTE:** this will also install the official aptly repo in your sources.list.d.

### Enable aptly API endpoint

To:
 * enable the aptly API management
 * make the API listen on port `42000`
 * have the API listen on the private interface of your server (let's say this interface's IP is `10.0.0.123`)
 * have the API configured in no-lock mode as you are doing both cli and API calls

Then you can do:
```puppet
class { 'aptly':
  enable_api => true,
  api_port   => 42000,
  api_bind   => '10.0.0.123',
  api_nolock => true,
}
```

Or using hiera:
```yaml
---
aptly::enable_api: true
aptly::api_port: 42000
aptly::api_bind: 10.0.0.123
aptly::api_nolock: true
```

### Create an apt mirror

**Warning:** after creating the mirror, the update of the mirror from its source
is initiated. This can take a significant amount of time.

To create an APT repository:
 * of the Debian US repo
 * of the stable distribution
 * only taking the main component
 * only for the amd64 architecture

Use:
```puppet
aptly::mirror { 'debian_stable':
  location      => 'http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/',
  distribution  => 'stable',
  components    => [ 'main' ],
  architectures => ['amd64'],
}
```

**Note:** This module does not manage the gpg keys directly, so if you don't take care of adding the gpg file of your target repository,
you'll end up with the following error:

```
Error: /Stage[main]/Main/Aptly::Mirror[debian_stable]/Aptly_mirror[debian_stable]/ensure: change from absent to present failed: Execution of 'aptly -architectures=amd64 -with-sources=false -with-udebs=false mirror create debian_stable http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ stable main' returned 1: Looks like your keyring with trusted keys is empty. You might consider importing some keys.
If you're running Debian or Ubuntu, it's a good idea to import current archive keys by running:

  gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg --export | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --import

(for Ubuntu, use /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg)

Looks like some keys are missing in your trusted keyring, you may consider importing them from keyserver:

gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 8B48AD6246925553 7638D0442B90D010 CBF8D6FD518E17E1

Sometimes keys are stored in repository root in file named Release.key, to import such key:

wget -O - https://some.repo/repository/Release.key | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --import

ERROR: unable to fetch mirror: verification of detached signature failed: exit status 2
```

Here's a full example of how you can manage your gpg keys along with the mirror:
```puppet
aptly::mirror { 'debian_stable':
  location      => 'http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/',
  distribution  => 'stable',
  components    => [ 'main'] ,
  architectures => ['amd64'],
}

exec { 'debian_stable_key_8B48AD6246925553':
  command => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 8B48AD6246925553',
  unless  => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --list-key 8B48AD6246925553 > /dev/null 2>&1',
}

exec { 'debian_stable_key_7638D0442B90D010':
  command => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 7638D0442B90D010',
  unless  => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --list-key 7638D0442B90D010 > /dev/null 2>&1',
}

exec { 'debian_stable_key_CBF8D6FD518E17E1':
  command => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key CBF8D6FD518E17E1',
  unless  => '/usr/bin/gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --list-key CBF8D6FD518E17E1 > /dev/null 2>&1',
}


Exec['debian_stable_key_8B48AD6246925553']->
Exec['debian_stable_key_7638D0442B90D010']->
Exec['debian_stable_key_CBF8D6FD518E17E1']->
Aptly::Mirror['debian_stable']
```

### Create and drop apt repositories

Using the `aptly::repo` is really simple. In this example, we will:
 * drop the `my_custom_repo` repository
 * create the `tubemogul_apps` repository (with "stable" as default component
   for publishing)

Use:
```puppet
# Dropping the 'my_custom_repo' repo
aptly::repo {'my_custom_repo':
  ensure => absent,
}

# Making sure that the 'tubemogul_apps' exists with the expected parameters
aptly::repo {'tubemogul_apps':
  default_component => 'stable',
}
```

Once you've done that, you can add packages using the `aptly repo add tubemogul_apps my_package.deb` or using the API.

### Create an aptly snapshot

Once you've created your repo and added packages to it, you might want to take a
snapshot of a stable stack or a coherent ensemble to publish it later.

This example creates a snapshot named `nightly_20160823` based on the repository
`tubemogul_apps` that we created in the previous example:

```puppet
aptly::snapshot { 'nightly_20160823':
  source_type => 'repository',
  source_name => 'tubemogul_apps',
}
```

## Limitations

This module has been tested against Puppet 3.8 with Ubuntu clients.

The spec tests work on Puppet 3.7+ and 4.x.

To work on Debian OS family servers, it requires the apt module from Puppetlabs
to be installed if you want to have this module manage your aptly repository (optionnal).

The implementation for the installation on other operating systems has not been
done yet but should be pretty straightforward to do. Just ask which one you want
and we'll add it or submit a pull request on our github page and we'll integrate
it.


## Development

We're actually nice people and we rarely bite, so you're more than welcome to
contribute to our repos via the usual GitHub PR and issues.

What we ask generally is that when you push a change or a new functionnality,
you add the corresponding tests at the same time. You'll find a lot of tests
examples in this repository.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tubemogul/puppet-aptly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more detailed guidelines.
